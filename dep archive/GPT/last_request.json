For example, a MonoBehaviour that defines a Transform field. Fields that reference a UnityEngine.Object like this do not require the SerializeReference attribute, because the serialization for the field always records the reference to an independently-serialized object.\r\n\r\nOther field types, by value:\r\nIf the field type is one that Unity can automatically serialize by value (simple field types, such as int, string, Vector3, etc), or if it is a custom serializable class or structure marked with the [Serializable] attribute, it is serialized as a value.\r\nIn the case of a custom serializable class, this means it serializes only the data belonging to the object assigned to the field, rather than a reference to the object itself. To force Unity to serialize these field types as a reference, use the [SerializeReference] attribute.\r\n\r\nYou might want to serialize as a reference rather than a value when:\r\nYou want multiple references to the same instance of a custom serializable class.\r\nFor example, reference serialization is necessary for reference-based topologies based on custom serializable classes (such as linked lists, tree structures, or cyclical graphs). This is because the default value-based serialization stores each reference as a separate copy of the object, when fields originally shared a single reference to the same object. In particular, if you serialize a cyclical graph data structure, you must use SerializeReference to preserve the graph properly and to avoid potential freezes or crashes that can arise from the default serialization approach.\r\n\r\nYou want to use polymorphism on fields whose type is a custom serializable class.\r\nIf you try to use polymorphism on custom serializable classes without the [SerializeReference] attribute, your derived classes' additional fields won't be preserved, and your object will instead be serialized as if it was the field's declared type. You can see polymorphism in the SerializeReferencePolymorphismExample class below.\r\n\r\nYou want to serialize null values.\r\nValue-based serialization can't represent null. Without the use of SerializeReference, null values are replaced with an inline object that has unassigned fields in the serialized data. Using SerializeReference allows you to store null references."

      "content": "Unity's `PropertyDrawer` system does not support interfaces directly. `PropertyDrawer` in Unity works with concrete types, so it can't be applied to an interface directly.\n\nHowever, there's a workaround that can somewhat ease the process:\n\n1. You would still need to create a `PropertyDrawer` for each class that implements that interface. This can be tedious if you have many classes.\n2. A slightly better way is to create base class `PropertyDrawer` that handles the drawing of properties common to all implementing classes.\n3. Then, you can create a specific `PropertyDrawer` for each implementing class, but these drawers can subclass the base class you created. This way, you're only coding the common behavior once in the base class `PropertyDrawer`, and only coding the differences in the subclasses.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEditor;\n\npublic interface IExampleInterface { }\n\n[CustomPropertyDrawer(typeof(IExampleInterface))]\npublic class ExampleInterfaceDrawer : PropertyDrawer\n{\n    public override void OnGUI(Rect position, SerializedProperty property, GUIContent label)\n    {\n        // Common drawing code goes here\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ExampleClass : IExampleInterface { }\n\n[CustomPropertyDrawer(typeof(ExampleClass))]\npublic class ExampleClassDrawer : ExampleInterfaceDrawer\n{\n    public override void OnGUI(Rect position, SerializedProperty property, GUIContent label)\n    {\n        // Class specific drawing code goes here\n\n        // Call base class drawing method\n        base.OnGUI(position, property, label);\n    }\n}\n```\nNote that, even though we defined `CustomPropertyDrawer(typeof(IExampleInterface))` , this doesn't mean that the drawer will apply to every class that implements the interface. It's actually not going to work directly because as mentioned earlier, Unity does not directly support interface PropertyDrawers. We're doing it in this way to lay out a reasonable structure for the code."
